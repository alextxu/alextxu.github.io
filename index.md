## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently applying for PhD programs for the Fall 2024 admission cycle.

I am currently working with Professor Louis-Philippe Morency's MultiComp Lab on a low-resource knowledge distillation project. Previously, I worked on a social norms modeling project with Professor Reid Simmons, where we tracked social norms violations in real-time in realistic applications with reinforcement learning agents.

## Research Interests

- **AI Personalization:** LLM alignment, few-shot finetuning with human-AI interactions
- **AI Social Intelligence:** modeling social norms, LLM social intelligence benchmarks
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, foundational models, knowledge distillation, reinforcement learning
