## About Me

I am a Computer Science Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor Reid Simmons. I am part of the Reliable Autonomous Systems Lab (RASL).

I am also currently working with Professor Chenyan Xiong on a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) project. Previously, I was fortunate to work with Professor Louis-Philippe Morency's MultiComp Lab on a low-resource knowledge distillation project. Before that, I have also worked on a social norms modeling project with RASL, where we tracked social norms violations in real-time in realistic applications with reinforcement learning agents.

## Research Interests

- **AI Personalization:** LLM alignment, few-shot finetuning with human-AI interactions
- **AI Social Intelligence:** modeling social norms, LLM social intelligence benchmarks
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, foundational models, knowledge distillation, reinforcement learning
